<h2> Music </h2>
<p>Disco is a genre of music that became popular in the United States in the 1970s. Disco was known for its upbeat catchy tempo played by electric pianos, synthesizers (a type of piano) and guitars. The vocals are also known to be repetitive. Artists that have made an influence in the Disco world were singers such as Donna Summer, Bees Gees, Gloria Gaynor, and Kool & the Gang. Although Disco did not last long, artists were able to leave a legacy.</p>

        <h2> When was Disco popular? </h2>

        <p>The word disco came from discotheques, which was used in France in the 1940’s, to describe the first dance music venues that we now call clubs. The first claimed disco party to be held in the United States was at “The Loft” on Valentine’s Day in 1970. Disco is known to be a 70s thing, but did you know that it wasn’t popular until the late 70s and early 80s? Disco was slowly introduced in the United States in the early 70s, but didn’t take a boom until the movie “Saturday Night Fever” with John Travolta premiered. After the premiere, disco was at its peak in popularity. </p>
